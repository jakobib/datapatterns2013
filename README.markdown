# A pattern language of data structuring

This git repository contains a pattern language of data structuring, developed
as part of my PhD thesis "Describing data patterns" (Voß 2013, not published
yet). The latest version of the repository can be found at:

<https://github.org/nichtich/datapatterns.git>

## How this repository is organized

Each data pattern is described in a Markdown file with file extension `.md`.
The classification of patterns is defined in `groups.yaml`. All remaining
files are scripts and templates for nice views of the pattern language.
