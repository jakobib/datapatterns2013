# A pattern language of data structuring

This git repository contains a pattern language of data structuring, developed
as part of my PhD thesis *Describing data patterns* (Voß 2013, not published
yet). The latest version of the repository can be found at:

<https://github.org/jakobib/datapatterns2013.git>

## How this repository is organized

Each data pattern is described in a Pandoc Markdown file with file extension
`.md`. The classification of patterns is defined in `groups.yaml`.

All remaining files are scripts and templates for nice views of the pattern
language in HTML and LaTeX/PDF. The code is rather crude for historical
reasons.
